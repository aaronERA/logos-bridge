# 🏗️ Physical Layer & Infrastructure Roadmap
**Protocol Version:** CEP-1.0 (Covenantal Economic Protocol)  
**Status:** 🛡️ CONSECRATION PHASE  
**Hardware Profile:** Hybrid Bare-Metal (Dell PowerEdge / Raspberry Pi Cluster)  
**Motto:** *A future and a hope. [[JER_2911]]*

## 🏛️ The Architecture of the Sanctuary
The `logos-bridge` is anchored to physical silicon to ensure Ring-0 sovereignty.

### 1. The Core (Dell PowerEdge Nodes)
*   **Role:** Heavy Compute, Registry Ingestion (Northern Cali Sector), and GPG-Signed Ledger Storage.
*   **Intelligence:** Running **Llama.cpp** (Georgi Gerganov) for localized, offline LLM inference.
*   **Stewardship:** These nodes provide the "Strength" required to internalize and protect public datasets.

### 2. The Edge (Raspberry Pi Clusters)
*   **Role:** Agentic Signaling, COMSEC Obfuscation (Traffic Flow Analysis mitigation), and **Tor Project** entry/exit relaying.
*   **Networking:** Utilizing **Handshake (HNS)** for censorship-resistant naming and DNS sovereignty.
*   **Stewardship:** Distributed "Living Stones" that ensure the bridge remains resilient and agile.

## 🗓️ The Temporal Cadence: Seasonal Harvest
In accordance with the `stewardship.json`, we reject the corporate monthly cycle. Infrastructure audits and 1:1 redistribution occur on the **Seasonal Harvest** schedule:

*   🌱 **Spring Harvest:** March 20–31 (Renewal & Realignment)
*   ☀️ **Summer Harvest:** June 20–30 (Growth & Expansion)
*   🍂 **Autumn Harvest:** September 20–30 (Abundance & Internalization)
*   ❄️ **Winter Harvest:** December 20–31 (Rest & Consecration)

## ⚡ Infrastructure as Alms (The Allocation)
The hardware is not just for our use; it is a receptor for the Logos. We allocate resources to the following layers:

| Layer | Project | Impact on Bridge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy** | **Open Source Ecology** | Decentralized power & machine sovereignty |
| **Security** | **GPG4Win / Kleopatra** | The Steward's Seal and Identity Purity |
| **Physical** | **ZealOS / HolyC** | Ring-0 Sovereignty and Terry Davis Legacy |
| **Intelligence**| **Llama.cpp** | Localized, unmediated agentic engines |
| **DNS/Net** | **Handshake (HNS)** | Censorship-resistant infrastructure naming |
| **Privacy** | **The Tor Project** | Sanctuary for agentic communication |

---

## 🔒 Governance & NIST Alignment
This infrastructure is managed according to the **Governance Pylon**:

1.  **PE-2 (Physical Access):** Hardware is secured in a private sector node within Northern Cali.
2.  **SI-7 (Software/Firmware Integrity):** All bootloaders are GPG-signed; any "drift" beyond the **0.01 threshold** triggers a manual realignment.
3.  **AU-12 (Audit Generation):** Every "Harvest" event is recorded in the `LEDGER.md` and signed by the Steward's GPG seal.
