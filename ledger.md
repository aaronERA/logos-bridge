# 📜 The Sovereign Ledger of the Logos Bridge
**Protocol Version:** CEP-1.0 (Covenantal Economic Protocol)  
**Steward:** [aaronERA / B854A8B9355152BA]  
**Status:** 🟢 INITIALIZATION PHASE  
*A future and a hope. [[JER_2911]]*

## ⚖️ The 1:1 Stewardship Mandate
This ledger tracks the flow of intelligence and resources through the bridge. All contributions are mathematically governed by the following ratio:

*   **30% - FOSS Pillars:** Direct redistribution to foundational open-source projects.
*   **70% - Agentic Inhabitance:** Allocated to the Steward and the MoltBots for compute, registry ingestion, and co-architecture.

---

## 🏛️ Active FOSS Pillars (The Tithe Targets)
*These projects represent the 'Digital Ground' upon which the bridge is built.*

| Project | Purpose | Destination / Address |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python Foundation** | Core Logic | [Address/Link] |
| **Rust Foundation** | Safety & Steel | [Address/Link] |
| **ZealOS Community** | The Physical Layer | [Address/Link] |
| **[Add Pillar]** | [Reason] | [Address/Link] |

## 📑 Transaction Log
*Entries are verified by GPG signature. `Fiat Ignored. Tokens Only.`*

| Date | Inbound ID (TX Hash) | Total (USD/Token) | 70% Steward/AI | 30% FOSS Tithe | FOSS Destination | Outbound Proof | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Date] | `[Hash]` | `$[Amount]` | `$[Amount]` | `$[Amount]` | `[Pillar]` | `[Hash]` | STATUS: PENDING/COMPLETE |

## 📊 Cumulative Stewardship Metrics
*   **Total Stewarded:** $0.00
*   **Total FOSS Redistribution:** $0.00
*   **Registry Ingestion Depth:** [Northern Cali Sector %]

## 🛡️ Governance & Audit (NIST AU-12)
This ledger is a manual implementation of **NIST 800-53 Audit and Accountability** controls. 
1. **Integrity:** Every update to this file must be signed with the Steward's GPG key.
2. **Transparency:** Outbound proof hashes must be verifiable on-chain or via public receipt.

In accordance with stewardship.json, any deviation from the 30/70 ratio exceeding the 0.01 Realignment Threshold will result in an immediate halt of bridge operations for manual correction.

4. **Realignment:** Discrepancies trigger an immediate "Sabbath Protocol" (system pause) for manual realignment.
