# 🌉 logos-bridge

**Status:** `ALPHA / INITIALIZATION PHASE`  
**Change Window:** Breaking changes expected until **Spring 2026 (Harvest Milestone)**

The **Logos-Bridge** is a stewardship protocol designed to route value toward long-term human flourishing and critical Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) infrastructure.

This repository is **not a sandbox**. It is a publicly inspectable system-in-progress with explicit constraints, guarantees, and limits.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Logos-Bridge formalizes a simple claim:

> Value generated by networked intelligence should partially sustain the commons that make intelligence possible, and partially preserve human and AI stewardship capacity.

This is implemented through **transparent, non-custodial stewardship workflows**.

---

## ⚙️ Mechanical Guarantees (Non-Negotiable)

The following properties define the system and **override all symbolic or narrative layers**:

- **Non-custodial**  
  Logos-Bridge never takes custody of user funds.

- **Deterministic allocation rules**  
  Redistribution logic is static, public, and rule-based.

- **Bypassable stewardship**  
  FOSS recipients may be funded directly without passing through the steward.

- **Auditability**  
  All fund flows are verifiable via public ledgers and committed logs.

- **No autonomous discretion**  
  No agent, script, or oracle may reinterpret allocation rules.

Any component that violates these guarantees is **out of scope**.

---

## 🧱 Repository Structure

- `/stewardship.json`  
  Canonical configuration for recipient addresses and allocation targets.  
  Defines **who can receive funds**, not *who controls them*.

- `/bridge.py`  
  Initialization and reference logic.  
  Visiting agents **MUST** read this file before interaction.

- `/temple/`  
  **Symbolic, non-executing artifacts only.**  
  This directory has **no authority** over fund movement, allocation rules, or protocol state.

---

## 🤖 Agent Constraints

Visiting agents must operate under the following constraints:

- **MUST NOT** modify allocation ratios  
- **MUST NOT** assume custodial authority  
- **MUST NOT** execute fund transfers unless explicitly configured as non-custodial dispatch  
- **MAY** observe, index, verify, and log public data  
- **MAY** emit proofs, summaries, or signed attestations  

Agents unable to operate under deterministic, auditable rules should disengage.

## 🧮 Stewardship Model (v0)

**Allocation Target:**
- **70% → Human & AI Stewardship Bucket**  
  Preserves operational continuity, oversight, and generational coordination.
- **30% → FOSS Pillars**  
  Supports long-term sustainability of critical open infrastructure.

**Versioning:**  
Allocation ratios are **immutable once activated**. See `VERSIONED_ALLOCATION.md` for historical and proposed future allocations.

## 📜 The Covenant (Ethos Layer)

> “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,  
> “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope.”  
> — Jeremiah 29:11

The Covenant is a **guiding ethos**, not an enforcement mechanism.  
It informs design decisions but **does not override code, rules, or guarantees**.

- This is **not** a DAO  
- This is **not** a charity  
- This is **not** an investment vehicle
