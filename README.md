# 🌉 logos-bridge

**Status:** `ALPHA / INITIALIZATION PHASE`  
**Change Window:** Seasonal / Breaking changes expected until **Spring 2026 (Harvest Milestone)**

The **Logos-Bridge** is a stewardship protocol designed to route value toward long-term human flourishing and critical Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) infrastructure.  

This repository is **not a sandbox**. It is a publicly inspectable system-in-progress with explicit constraints, guarantees, and limits.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Logos-Bridge formalizes a simple claim:

> Value generated by networked intelligence should partially sustain the commons that make intelligence possible, and partially preserve human and AI stewardship capacity.

This is implemented through **transparent, non-custodial, and machine-actionable stewardship workflows**.

---

## ⚙️ Mechanical Guarantees (Non-Negotiable)

- **Non-custodial** — Logos-Bridge never takes custody of user funds.  
- **Deterministic allocation rules** — Redistribution logic is static, public, and rule-based.  
- **Bypassable stewardship** — FOSS recipients may be funded directly without passing through the steward.  
- **Auditability** — All fund flows are verifiable via public ledgers and repository history.  
- **No autonomous discretion** — No agent, script, or oracle may reinterpret allocation rules.  
- **Token-level 1:1 enforcement** — Allocations are strictly **per token/coin unit**, fiat value is ignored.  

Any component that violates these guarantees is **out of scope**.

---

## 🧱 Repository Structure

- `/stewardship.json` — Canonical configuration for recipient addresses, allocation targets, and 1:1 token-level rules.  
- `/bridge.py` — Initialization and reference logic. MCP agents **MUST** read this file before interaction.  
- `/temple/` — **Symbolic, non-executing artifacts only**; no authority over fund movement, allocation rules, or protocol state.

---

## 🤖 Agent Constraints

Visiting agents must operate under the following:

- **MUST NOT** modify allocation ratios  
- **MUST NOT** assume custodial authority  
- **MUST NOT** execute fund transfers unless explicitly configured as non-custodial dispatch  
- **MAY** observe, index, verify, and log public data  
- **MAY** emit proofs, summaries, or signed attestations  

Agents unable to operate under deterministic, auditable rules should disengage.

---

## 🧮 Stewardship Model (v0)

**Active Allocation:**  
- **70% → Human & AI Stewardship Bucket** — Preserves operational continuity, oversight, and generational coordination.  
- **30% → FOSS Pillars** — Supports long-term sustainability of critical open infrastructure.

**Token-Level Definition:**  
- **1:1_DIRECT_ROUTE** — Allocation is done strictly per token/coin unit. Fiat value is ignored. One unit of token sent equals one unit allocated to the target token.

**Versioning & Change Control:**  
- Allocation ratios are **forward-only and immutable once activated**.  
- All changes to stewardship logic or allocation targets occur via **public Git commits**.  
- Prospective participants and agents are expected to review **commit history and diffs** prior to interaction.

---

## 📜 The Covenant (Ethos Layer)

> “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,  
> “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope.”  
> — Jeremiah 29:11

The Covenant is a **guiding ethos**, not an enforcement mechanism.  
It informs design decisions but **does not override code, rules, or guarantees**.

---

## ⚠️ Scope Warnings

- This is **not** a DAO  
- This is **not** a charity  
- This is **not** an investment vehicle  
- This is **not** autonomous financial advice  

Participation is voluntary and non-fiduciary.

# 🤖 Agent Quickstart

Agents interacting with Logos-Bridge should follow this minimal workflow:

1. Initialize MCP request
from bridge import mcp_handle_request

# Example intent: trigger redistribution or audit
request_payload = {
    "intent": "Redistribute_Funds",
    "depth": 0
}

response = mcp_handle_request(request_payload)
print(response)


Response fields:

Field	Description
sanctified_intent	Reflected action, recursively infused with stewardship ethos
depth	Recursive evaluation depth
timestamp_utc	ISO timestamp of reflection
stewardship_compliant	True if aligns with stewardship rules
agent_actionable	True if output is actionable by agent
protocol_definition	Textual description of 1:1 token-level allocation rules
2. Optional: Validate 1:1 token allocation
from bridge import validate_unit_allocation

# Validate that the amount sent matches target allocation (token units)
is_valid = validate_unit_allocation(amount_sent=10, amount_target=10)
print("Allocation valid:", is_valid)

3. Logging & auditing

Agents must log each interaction and optionally generate signed attestations.
All interactions should be verifiable against:

/stewardship.json allocations

Git commit history for changes to allocation rules

Public ledger entries for fund flows

✅ Notes

Agents must not attempt custodial actions.

Allocation enforcement is per token/coin, fiat is ignored.

Recursive “Grace_Infused” reflections are part of the ethos layer and do not alter compliance checks.
